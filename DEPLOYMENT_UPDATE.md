# Deployment Update - UI Support Added

## Summary
Successfully added web UI support to cloud_api.py and deployed to AWS dev environment.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added UI Support to cloud_api.py (Commit 5f8cb04)
- Imported `StaticFiles`, `Jinja2Templates`, `Request`, and `HTMLResponse` from FastAPI
- Mounted `/static` directory for serving static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- Configured Jinja2 templates for HTML rendering
- Changed root endpoint `/` to serve `index.html` instead of returning JSON
- Added `/api` endpoint for API information (moved from root)

### 2. Updated Dockerfile (Commit 5f8cb04)
- Added `COPY static/ ./static/` to include static files
- Added `COPY templates/ ./templates/` to include HTML templates

### 3. Added Missing Dependency (Commit 907f799)
- Added `jinja2==3.1.2` to `requirements-cloud.txt`
- Fixed AssertionError that was preventing container startup

## Task Definition
- **Current**: multi-agent-system:20
- **Status**: Running successfully with 1 task
- **Resources**: 256 CPU, 512 MB RAM

## Verification

```bash
# Homepage returns HTML UI
curl http://multi-agent-system-alb-1995918544.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/

# Health endpoint confirms system is running
curl http://multi-agent-system-alb-1995918544.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com/health
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-02T17:55:10.035997",
  "environment": "dev",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "agents_registered": 6
}
```

## Resolution

The deployment now matches the original app.py functionality:
- ✅ Serves web UI at root URL
- ✅ Provides REST API endpoints
- ✅ Has interactive documentation
- ✅ Runs on AWS ECS with Fargate
- ✅ All dependencies properly installed

The user's issue is resolved - the root URL now displays the full web interface instead of returning a "Not Found" error.
