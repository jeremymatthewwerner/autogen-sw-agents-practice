# Claude Session State - Last Updated: 2025-10-03 21:40 BST

## Current Task
**Objective**: Get E2E browser tests passing in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

## Status: ❌ NOT COMPLETE
- Tests pass locally ✅
- All fixes committed ✅  
- **BLOCKED**: Cannot verify in CI due to network issues ❌
- **NEXT**: Trigger E2E Browser Tests workflow and verify it passes

## Recent Work Timeline

### Session Start (Oct 2, ~18:00)
- User asked "what's next?"
- Found 3 tasks: fix tests, implement AWS deployment, cleanup
- User gave explicit directive: "do all 3 and don't stop to ask me along the way"

### Deployment Issues (Oct 2, 18:00-19:00)
- Successfully deployed cloud_api.py to AWS dev environment
- Fixed multiple issues:
  1. Secrets Manager key mismatch (uppercase vs lowercase)
  2. Dockerfile CMD syntax error
  3. Missing legacy UI endpoints (/status, /develop)
  4. Missing jinja2 dependency
  5. Missing UI files (static/, templates/)

### User Found Issues (Oct 3, ~18:00)
**CRITICAL FEEDBACK**: User found UI broken
1. Root URL returned `{"detail":"Not Found"}`
2. Agent status showed "Unable to load agent status"

**User's frustration**: "you are saying you are doing UI testing but I've now found two issues on first load"

### E2E Test Fixes (Oct 3, 18:00-21:00)
Fixed Playwright browser tests:
1. ✅ Removed silent `pytest.skip()` calls
2. ✅ Added `test_agent_status_loads()` to catch "Unable to load" errors
3. ✅ Increased timeouts to 30s
4. ✅ Fixed Swagger UI selector

Created E2E workflow (`.github/workflows/e2e-browser-tests.yml`):
- Triggers after successful AWS deployment
- Multiple iteration attempts to fix:
  1. ✅ Playwright CLI not found → `python -m playwright`
  2. ✅ Ubuntu 24.04 libasound2 issue → `ubuntu-22.04`
  3. ✅ conftest.py import errors → `--ignore` flags
  4. ⏳ **UNVERIFIED**: Last fix not tested in CI

## Current State

### Last Successful Verification
- **Local tests**: 4/4 passing (test_homepage_loads, test_agent_status_loads, test_health_endpoint, test_api_docs_accessible)
- **Deployed app**: Working at http://multi-agent-system-alb-1995918544.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
- **Last successful deployment**: Oct 2, 18:11 UTC (task definition 17)

### Last Known CI/CD Status
- **Deploy workflow**: Last success Oct 2 (commit 9a431d0 "Add legacy UI endpoints")  
- **E2E Browser Tests**: Last run FAILED (18232598560)
  - Error: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'autogen_agentchat'`
  - Cause: pytest loading conftest.py which imports agent code
  - Fix applied: Added `--ignore=tests/conftest.py` flags (commit b5c3f74)
  - **NOT VERIFIED**: No successful run since this fix

### Pending Verification
```bash
# Need to run this workflow and verify it passes
gh workflow run "E2E Browser Tests" --field environment=dev

# Then check status
gh run list --workflow="E2E Browser Tests" --limit 1
```

### Critical Files
```

## Important Context

### User's Expectations
- **Autonomous operation**: "run for mins or even hours at a time without my involvement"
- **Don't ask permission**: Has YOLO mode enabled, wants continuous execution
- **Verify before declaring success**: User caught me claiming tests worked when they didn't
- **Test the basics**: User found UI broken because I only tested APIs, not actual UI

### Technical Gotchas Learned
1. **Playwright in CI**: 
   - Use `ubuntu-22.04` (not latest/24.04)
   - Use `python -m playwright install --with-deps chromium`
   - Isolate E2E tests from app dependencies
   
2. **E2E tests should be standalone**:
   - Don't import from agents/ or main app
   - Use `--ignore` for conftest.py if needed
   - Minimal dependencies (pytest, playwright only)

3. **Never declare victory without CI verification**:
   - Local passing ≠ CI passing
   - Must verify full pipeline end-to-end
   - Don't claim "done" until user confirms

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Trigger E2E Browser Tests workflow
   ```bash
   gh workflow run "E2E Browser Tests" --field environment=dev
   ```

2. **VERIFY**: Check if tests pass
   ```bash
   gh run watch $(gh run list --workflow="E2E Browser Tests" --limit 1 -q '.[0].databaseId')
   ```

3. **IF PASS**: Update user that E2E tests are now working in CI
   
4. **IF FAIL**: Debug the new error and iterate

5. **ALWAYS**: Verify deployment at http://multi-agent-system-alb-1995918544.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com still works

## Environment Details
- **AWS Region**: us-east-1
- **Dev URL**: http://multi-agent-system-alb-1995918544.us-east-1.elb.amazonaws.com
- **ECS Cluster**: multi-agent-system-cluster
- **ECS Service**: multi-agent-system-service
- **Task Definition**: multi-agent-system:17 (last successful)
- **GitHub Repo**: jeremymatthewwerner/autogen-sw-agents-practice
- **Branch**: main

## User Feedback to Remember
- "please stop asking me for things like this always run until you are done"
- "i'm getting frustrated, you are saying you are doing UI testing but I've now found two issues"
- "please fix the playwright browser automation issues - we need to include browser regression tests in CI/CD"
- "if so why do I only see red here?" (all E2E tests failing in GitHub Actions)

## Session End State
- **Network issues**: Cannot reach api.github.com
- **Last action attempted**: Triggering E2E workflow (failed due to network)
- **Status**: INCOMPLETE - need to verify E2E tests pass in CI
- **User switching**: From VSCode plugin to CLI (this file created for context transfer)
